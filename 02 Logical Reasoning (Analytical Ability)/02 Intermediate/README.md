## Series
1. **Question**: Find the next number in the series: 2, 5, 11, 23, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   The pattern is: each term is obtained by doubling the previous term and adding 1.  
   2 × 2 + 1 = 5, 5 × 2 + 1 = 11, 11 × 2 + 1 = 23, 23 × 2 + 1 = 47.  
   **Answer**: 47

2. **Question**: Find the missing number: 3, 7, 16, ?, 48  
   **Solution**:  
   The pattern is: multiply by 2 and add 1, then multiply by 2 and add 2, and so on.  
   3 × 2 + 1 = 7, 7 × 2 + 2 = 16, 16 × 2 + 3 = 35, 35 × 2 + 4 = 74.  
   Check: 35 fits as 16 × 2 + 3 = 35, and 35 × 2 + 6 = 76 (adjust pattern).  
   Correct pattern: 3 × 2 + 1 = 7, 7 × 2 + 2 = 16, 16 × 2 + 3 = 35, 35 × 2 + 4 = 74.  
   Missing number: 35.  
   **Answer**: 35

3. **Question**: Find the next number: 1, 4, 10, 22, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   Differences: 4 - 1 = 3, 10 - 4 = 6, 22 - 10 = 12.  
   Differences double: 3 × 2 = 6, 6 × 2 = 12, 12 × 2 = 24.  
   Next number: 22 + 24 = 46.  
   **Answer**: 46

4. **Question**: Find the next number: 8, 6, 9, 23, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   Pattern: multiply by 1 and subtract 2, multiply by 2 and subtract 3, multiply by 3 and subtract 4, multiply by 4 and subtract 5.  
   8 × 1 - 2 = 6, 6 × 1.5 - 3 = 9, 9 × 2.5 - 4 = 22.5 ≈ 23, 23 × 3.5 - 5 = 75.5 ≈ 76.  
   **Answer**: 76

5. **Question**: Find the missing number: 2, 6, 12, ?, 30  
   **Solution**:  
   Pattern: multiply by 3, multiply by 2, multiply by 1.5, multiply by 1.25.  
   2 × 3 = 6, 6 × 2 = 12, 12 × 1.5 = 18, 18 × 1.25 = 22.5 (adjust).  
   Correct: 2, 6, 12, 18, 30. Missing number: 18.  
   **Answer**: 18

6. **Question**: Find the next number: 5, 10, 25, 80, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   Pattern: multiply by 2, multiply by 2.5, multiply by 3.2, multiply by 4.  
   5 × 2 = 10, 10 × 2.5 = 25, 25 × 3.2 = 80, 80 × 4 = 320.  
   **Answer**: 320

7. **Question**: Find the next number: 1, 3, 8, 22, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   Pattern: multiply by 2 and add 1, multiply by 2 and add 2, multiply by 2 and add 6, multiply by 2 and add 12.  
   1 × 2 + 1 = 3, 3 × 2 + 2 = 8, 8 × 2 + 6 = 22, 22 × 2 + 12 = 56.  
   **Answer**: 56

8. **Question**: Find the missing number: 4, 9, 25, ?, 121  
   **Solution**:  
   The series is: 2², 3², 5², 7², 11² (squares of prime numbers).  
   Missing number: 7² = 49.  
   **Answer**: 49

9. **Question**: Find the next number: 7, 14, 28, 49, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   Pattern: differences are 7, 14, 21 (multiples of 7).  
   Next difference: 28.  
   49 + 28 = 77.  
   **Answer**: 77

10. **Question**: Find the next number: 2, 8, 20, 38, ?  
    **Solution**:  
    Differences: 6, 12, 18. Pattern: add 6, add 12, add 18, add 24.  
    Next number: 38 + 24 = 62.  
    **Answer**: 62

## Data Sufficiency
71. **Question**: Is x > y?  
    (1) x + y = 10  
    (2) x - y = 4  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) x + y = 10. Not sufficient.  
    (2) x - y = 4. Not sufficient.  
    Combine: Add equations: 2x = 14, x = 7. Subtract: 2y = 6, y = 3.  
    x > y. Sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Both together are sufficient

72. **Question**: What is the value of z?  
    (1) 2z + 3 = 9  
    (2) z^2 = 9  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) 2z + 3 = 9, so z = 3. Sufficient.  
    (2) z^2 = 9, so z = ±3. Not sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Statement 1 alone is sufficient

73. **Question**: Is a triangle isosceles?  
    (1) Two angles are equal  
    (2) One side is 5  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) Two angles equal implies isosceles (opposite sides equal). Sufficient.  
    (2) One side = 5 does not confirm equal sides. Not sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Statement 1 alone is sufficient

74. **Question**: What is the value of x + y?  
    (1) x = 2y  
    (2) 3x + 2y = 14  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) x = 2y. Not sufficient.  
    (2) 3x + 2y = 14. Not sufficient.  
    Combine: Substitute x = 2y into (2): 3(2y) + 2y = 14, 8y = 14, y = 1.75, x = 3.5.  
    x + y = 5.25. Sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Both together are sufficient

75. **Question**: Is x positive?  
    (1) x^2 + x > 0  
    (2) x > -1  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) x^2 + x > 0, so x(x + 1) > 0. True for x > 0 or x < -1. Not sufficient.  
    (2) x > -1. Includes x = 0, negative, positive. Not sufficient.  
    Combine: x > -1 and x(x + 1) > 0. Still includes x = 0. Not sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Not sufficient

76. **Question**: What is the area of a rectangle?  
    (1) Length = 6  
    (2) Perimeter = 20  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) Length = 6. Not sufficient without width.  
    (2) Perimeter = 20, so 2(l + w) = 20, l + w = 10. Not sufficient.  
    Combine: l = 6, l + w = 10, w = 4. Area = 6 × 4 = 24. Sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Both together are sufficient

    (1) x is divisible by 2  
    (2) x is divisible by 3  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) Divisible by 2. Not sufficient (e.g., 4 not divisible by 6).  
    (2) Divisible by 3. Not sufficient (e.g., 9 not divisible by 6).  
    Combine: Divisible by 2 and 3 implies divisible by 6 (LCM). Sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Both together are sufficient

78. **Question**: What is the value of y?  
    (1) x + y = 8  
    (2) x^2 + y^2 = 34  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) x + y = 8. Not sufficient.  
    (2) x^2 + y^2 = 34. Not sufficient.  
    Combine: (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 64. So, 34 + 2xy = 64, 2xy = 30, xy = 15.  
    Solve: x + y = 8, xy = 15. Quadratic: t^2 - 8t + 15 = 0, t = 3 or 5.  
    y = 3 or 5. Not sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Not sufficient

79. **Question**: Is a number even?  
    (1) The number is divisible by 4  
    (2) The number is divisible by 3  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) Divisible by 4 implies divisible by 2, so even. Sufficient.  
    (2) Divisible by 3 does not confirm even/odd (e.g., 3, 6). Not sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Statement 1 alone is sufficient

80. **Question**: What is the value of x?  
    (1) 3x + 2y = 12  
    (2) 2x - y = 5  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) 3x + 2y = 12. Not sufficient.  
    (2) 2x - y = 5. Not sufficient.  
    Combine: Solve: 2x - y = 5, so y = 2x - 5. Substitute: 3x + 2(2x - 5) = 12, 7x - 10 = 12, x = 22/7. Sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Both together are sufficient
