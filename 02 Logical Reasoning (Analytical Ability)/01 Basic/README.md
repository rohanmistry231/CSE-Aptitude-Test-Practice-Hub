## Series
1. **Question**: Find the next number in the series: 2, 4, 6, 8, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   The series is arithmetic with a common difference of 2: 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6, 6 + 2 = 8.  
   Next number: 8 + 2 = 10.  
   **Answer**: 10

2. **Question**: Find the next number: 1, 3, 9, 27, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   The series is geometric: each term is multiplied by 3 (1 × 3 = 3, 3 × 3 = 9, 9 × 3 = 27).  
   Next number: 27 × 3 = 81.  
   **Answer**: 81

3. **Question**: Find the next number: 5, 10, 20, 40, ?  
   **Solution**:  
   Each term is multiplied by 2: 5 × 2 = 10, 10 × 2 = 20, 20 × 2 = 40.  
   Next number: 40 × 2 = 80.  
   **Answer**: 80

4. **Question**: Find the next number: 1, 4, 7, 10, ?  
   **Solution**:

   Next number: 10 + 3 = 13.  
   **Answer**: 13

5. **Question**: Find the missing number: 2, 5, 11, ?, 26  
   **Solution**:  
   The series follows a pattern: 2 × 2 + 1 = 5, 5 × 2 + 1 = 11, 11 × 2 + 1 = 23, 23 × 2 + 1 = 47.  
   Missing number: 23.  
   **Answer**: 23

## Data Sufficiency
71. **Question**: Is x > 5?  
    (1) x + 2 = 7  
    (2) x - 3 = 2  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) \( x + 2 = 7 \), so \( x = 5 \). Not sufficient (x = 5, not > 5).  
    (2) \( x - 3 = 2 \), so \( x = 5 \). Not sufficient.  
    Both give \( x = 5 \). Not sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Not sufficient

72. **Question**: What is the value of y?  
    (1) y + 4 = 10  
    (2) 2y = 12  
    **Solution**:  
    (1) \( y + 4 = 10 \), so \( y = 6 \). Sufficient.  
    (2) \( 2y = 12 \), so \( y = 6 \). Sufficient.  
    **Answer**: Each alone is sufficient

73. **Question**: Is a rectangle a square?  
    (1) All sides are equal  
    (2) One side is 5
