## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

Follow these steps to make the most of the CSE Aptitude Test Practice Hub:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohanmistry231/CSE-Aptitude-Test-Practice.git
   ```

2. **Choose a Category**  
   Start with a category you want to master (e.g., Quantitative Aptitude). Navigate to its directory (e.g., `Quantitative_Aptitude/`).

3. **Select a Difficulty Level**  
   - Begin with **Basic** to build confidence.  
   - Move to **Intermediate** for multi-step challenges.  
   - Tackle **Advanced** to prepare for tough test scenarios.  
   Each level has **100 questions** with solutions in a single Markdown file (e.g., `Quantitative_Aptitude_Basic.md`).

4. **Practice Strategically**  
   - Solve 10–15 questions daily to maintain consistency.  
   - Time yourself (e.g., 1 minute per question) to simulate test conditions.  
   - Review solutions to understand shortcuts and avoid mistakes.  
   - Track your progress by noting weak areas (e.g., percentages, puzzles).

5. **Leverage Technical Aptitude**

## 🎯 Tips for Success

- **Start Small**: Master Basic-level questions before progressing to Intermediate and Advanced.  
- **Simulate Exam Conditions**: Use a timer to practice under pressure (aim for 60–90 seconds per question).  
- **Focus on Weak Areas**: Identify topics you struggle with (e.g., time and work, data interpretation) and practice more questions from those sections.  
- **Combine with Coding Prep**: For AI/ML roles, pair aptitude practice with coding platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.  
- **Stay Consistent**: Dedicate 1–2 hours daily to aptitude practice for steady improvement.
